## The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript ##

UNION: In Typescript code the symbol is "|". Though the word "union" here technically refers to "or". 
For example: type Obj ={
    manufacturer: 'toyota'|'jinjira'
}
here we might use both manufacturer or only one of them.
INTERSECTION: In Typescript symbol for intersection is '&'. where include both objects common properties.
For example: type Obj1 ={
    manufacturer: 'toyota'|'jinjira',
    country: 'bangladesh'
}
interface Obj2 {
    model: 'civita'| 'Focus',
    year: 2089,
    country:'bangladesh'
}
type Object03 = Obj1 & Obj2 where all common keys are included.

SIGNIFICANCES:
For UNION  symbol uses '|' and for INTERSECTION symbol uses is '&'
UNION may included all keys properties while INTERSECTION allowes only common key properties.
